Itertools
---------

`This blog post`_ made me realize there's a bunch of good stuff in `itertools`.

chain.py
++++++++

Messing with `itertools.chain`.

I definitely see the usefulness of `chain` but nothing mind blowing here.
Take many iterables, chain them together into one iterable.


compress.py
+++++++++++

Messing with `itertools.compress`.

I get the concept... again, nothing mind blowing. I'm struggling to think
of a good usecase off the top of my head.


count.py
+++++++++++

Messing with `itertools.count`.

I like count but it seems weird that you can't give it a control.
A third arg saying "Stop here".


ifilter.py
+++++++++++

Messing with `itertools.ifilter`.


imap.py
+++++++++++

Messing with `itertools.imap.py`.
